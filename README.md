# compound-basic-dao

this is a basic DAO governance implementation. We have a simple contract (Box) which has a state variable (uint256 private value), and the only way to change it is through a decentralized vote. I recommend you reading the deploy.js (and its comments) to see how we set up the contracts, and how we propose, vote, queue, and execute new proposals.
